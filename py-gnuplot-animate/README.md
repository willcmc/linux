# Python + Gnuplot animation of data
This is a simple program (written almost entirely on [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) :P) that takes the data generated by [Performance_A320_climb.m](https://github.com/willcmc/flight-mech/blob/main/Performance_A320_climb.m) (which generates the climb profile of the popular narrow-body airliner Airbus A320) and converts it into an animation.

It is achieved by the following steps:
- Data files stored as .txt
- Python script generates corresponding [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) scripts (in my case, 360; one corresponding to each timestep)
- Python script runs the generated scripts
- Python script merges all the frames into a `.avi`

Let's all take a moment to appreciate how [IAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicated_airspeed), [TAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_airspeed), and [Mach number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number) change throughout the climb to cruise altitude!
